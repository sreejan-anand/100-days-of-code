## About
This repository contains daily coding exercises and solutions as part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. Each day focuses on solving programming problems in C, building foundational skills and problem‑solving techniques.

## Structure
- `day1/` to `day100/` – Each directory holds the source code and executables for that day's questions.
- Files are named as `day<number>_q<question_number>.c` for clarity.

## Purpose
The goal is to practice coding consistently, improve logical thinking, and master C programming concepts through hands‑on problem solving.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the desired day's directory.
2. Compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc dayX_qY.c -o output`).
3. Run the generated executable.
