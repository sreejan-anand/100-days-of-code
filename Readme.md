Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository documents my progress as I solve a variety of C programming problems, from basic syntax to more complex logic. Each day's solution is self-contained in its own independent branch to keep the project organized and focused.

## ü§ñ Project Automation

This repository is uniquely managed by a custom Python script (`run_challenge.py`) that automates the entire Git workflow. The script handles:
- Reading problem statements from a central `questions.json` file.
- Generating a formatted `question.md` for each day.
- Creating a clean, independent, and orphaned branch for each day's solution.
- Committing and pushing the solution and question files to the remote repository.
- A full-featured interactive menu for processing days, cleaning up branches, and managing the workflow.

## üöÄ Challenge Progress
